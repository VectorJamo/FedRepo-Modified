# Edits made to the FedRepo codebase

1. The dataset(CIFAR100) was not provideded. So we downloaded the dataset from from the author's link and integrated it into the project.
2. Needed to modify the 'path.py' file of the codebase to correctly be able to load the dataset.
3. Disabled cuda by default (As of 1/14/2025, I am using a system with no GPU). It was disabled by modifying the file config.py which contains the default parameter dictonary. Also, 
some functions take in arguments to use cuda or not, two of those were set to False. // self.set_control_cuda(self.client_controls[client], False)
4. The code was using data_iter.next() in scaffoldrs.py method on the DataLoader instance which is wrong. So it was replaced with next(data_iter).

With the above four modifications, the program successfully ran and we were able to run the code.
The entry point of the application is train_lab.py

To run, use the command:
python train_lab.py

It uses the CIFAR100 dataset(a dataset with 60000 images and their appropriate labels) to train the different Federated Machine Learning models.
